# ðŸ¤– Friend-bot ðŸ¤–
Always wanted a friend who will never lose sight of you? Meet Friend-bot, a robot that simply wants to be friends! Friend-bot will keep you in its sight and follow you around, just like a real friend would do. Be it a party or a fun weekend DIY project, Friend-bot is sure to bring a smile on everyone's face.

# Overview
Friend-bot uses computer vision to detect faces and moves towards the detected face. This creates an impression of an inquisitive friend who is always interested in you. The project uses a RaspberryPi 4 for face detection, an Arduino Nano for motor control, and a pair of Nema 17 motors driven by A4988 drivers for movement.

# Materials
To build your very own Friend-bot, you'll need:

2 x A4988 Stepper Motor Drivers
2 x Nema 17 Stepper Motors
1 x RaspberryPi 4
1 x Arduino Nano
1 x 4s LIPO Battery
Passive Components (Resistors, Capacitors, etc.)
Lots of enthusiasm! ðŸŽ‰
Setup and Installation
To setup Friend-bot, you'll need to have Python installed on your RaspberryPi along with OpenCV for face detection and PySerial for serial communication. The Arduino Nano needs the Arduino IDE for programming.

# Usage
Once you have Friend-bot set up, switch it on and it will start searching for a face in its field of vision. Once it finds a face, it will move towards it. If it loses sight of the face for more than a second, it will stop and wait for the face to appear again.

# Contributing
Got ideas to make Friend-bot even friendlier? We'd love to hear them! Please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

# License
Friend-bot is open source and is licensed under nothing. Have fun. Keep it safe. Don't get hurt

# Acknowledgments
Special thanks to the OpenAI team for developing ChatGPT, which played a crucial role in developing this project. We would also like to thank our friends and families for their continuous support and encouragement.

# Happy Building! ðŸš€
Get your hands dirty, have fun building your Friend-bot, and spread joy!
